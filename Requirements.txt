•	NF2. Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle a growing number of assets, users, and data without significant performance degradation.
B. Security:
•	NF3. Authentication: Secure user authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
•	NF4. Authorization: Role-based access control to ensure users can only access and modify data relevant to their roles.
•	NF5. Data Security: Measures to protect sensitive asset data from unauthorized access, modification, or loss (e.g., encryption, regular backups).
•	NF6. Audit Logging: Comprehensive logging of user activities and system events for security auditing.
C. Usability:

II. NON-Functional Requirements (How the system should behave):
I. Performance & Scalability:
1.	Response Time:
o	Requirement: The system must respond to user input (e.g., page loads, form submissions, search queries, report generation) within 3 seconds for 90% of all operations.
o	Justification: Ensures a smooth and efficient user experience, preventing user frustration and improving productivity for NEEPCO staff managing large asset inventories.
2.	Concurrency/Throughput:
o	Requirement: The system must be able to support at least 50 concurrent active users without significant performance degradation (response times exceeding 5 seconds).
o	Justification: NEEPCO likely has a large workforce. This ensures multiple departments/users can access and update asset data simultaneously without slowdowns.
3.	Data Volume Scalability:
o	Requirement: The system must be capable of storing and efficiently querying data for up to 500,000 assets and their associated historical records (maintenance logs, disposal history, etc.) for at least 10 years.
o	Justification: NEEPCO manages a vast and long-lived asset base. The system must accommodate future growth and provide comprehensive historical data for auditing, planning, and analysis.
II. Security:
4.	Authentication:
o	Requirement: The system must implement robust user authentication using a multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanism (e.g., OTP via email/SMS) for all administrative and managerial roles. Password policies must enforce complexity (minimum 12 characters, mix of upper/lower, numbers, special chars) and regular expiry.
o	Justification: Protecting sensitive asset data from unauthorized access is paramount for NEEPCO. MFA adds a critical layer of security beyond just passwords.
5.	Authorization (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC):
o	Requirement: The system must enforce a granular, role-based access control (RBAC) model, ensuring users can only view, create, modify, or delete data according to their assigned roles and permissions. This includes restrictions at the module level (e.g., only maintenance staff can schedule maintenance) and potentially at the asset type level (e.g., only IT staff can modify IT assets).
o	Justification: Prevents unauthorized data manipulation, protects against accidental data loss, and ensures compliance with internal NEEPCO policies.
6.	Data Encryption:
o	Requirement: All sensitive data (e.g., cost, purchase details, vendor information) must be encrypted at rest (in the database) and in transit (using HTTPS/SSL for all web traffic).
o	Justification: Protects against data breaches and eavesdropping, especially important for a government-related entity.
7.	Audit Trails & Logging:
o	Requirement: The system must maintain comprehensive, immutable audit trails for all significant data creation, modification, and deletion operations, including the user who performed the action, the timestamp, and the old/new values. All user logins and failed login attempts must also be logged.
o	Justification: Essential for accountability, troubleshooting, security investigations, and regulatory compliance for NEEPCO.
III. Reliability & Availability:
8.	High Availability (Uptime):
o	Requirement: The system must be designed for high availability with a target uptime of 99.5% (excluding planned maintenance windows).
o	Justification: Asset management is a critical function for NEEPCO's operations. Downtime can severely impact maintenance scheduling, asset tracking, and operational efficiency.
9.	Data Integrity:
o	Requirement: The system must implement robust data validation rules at the point of entry to prevent inconsistent or erroneous data from being stored (e.g., enforcing data types, mandatory fields, valid date ranges, unique serial numbers). Database constraints (foreign keys) must be used to ensure referential integrity.
o	Justification: Ensures the accuracy and reliability of asset data, which is crucial for decision-making and reporting.
10.	Backup and Recovery:
o	Requirement: The system must have a defined and tested data backup strategy (e.g., daily full backups, hourly incremental backups) with a clear recovery point objective (RPO) of less than 4 hours and a recovery time objective (RTO) of less than 8 hours in case of catastrophic data loss.
o	Justification: Protects against data loss due to hardware failure, software corruption, or cyber-attacks. NEEPCO cannot afford significant data loss or prolonged downtime.
IV. Usability & Maintainability:
11.	User-Friendliness (UI/UX):
o	Requirement: The system must feature an intuitive, consistent, and user-friendly interface, minimizing the learning curve for NEEPCO staff. It should be designed for ease of navigation and efficient data entry.
o	Justification: Directly impacts user adoption and productivity. A difficult-to-use system will lead to resistance and inefficiency.
12.	Maintainability & Extensibility:
o	Requirement: The system's codebase must be modular, well-documented, and adhere to Laravel best practices to facilitate future enhancements, bug fixes, and updates by development teams.
o	Justification: Ensures the long-term viability and adaptability of the system as NEEPCO's requirements evolve. Reduces technical debt and future development costs.
13.	Browser Compatibility:
o	Requirement: The system must be fully functional and render correctly on the latest stable versions of major web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) commonly used within NEEPCO, and potentially specific versions of Internet Explorer/Edge Legacy if still in use for legacy systems.
o	Justification: Ensures all NEEPCO users can access the system regardless of their browser choice.
14.	Accessibility (WCAG Compliance):
o	Requirement: The system's user interface should adhere to at least WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities (if relevant to NEEPCO's internal policies or government guidelines).
o	Justification: Ensures inclusivity and compliance with potential government accessibility mandates.
V. Environmental & Operational:
15.	Documentation:
o	Requirement: Comprehensive technical documentation (architecture, API, deployment guide) and user manuals must be provided.
o	Justification: Essential for onboarding new developers, troubleshooting, and empowering end-users.
16.	Portability (for future expansion):
o	Requirement: The system should be designed using widely adopted, open-source technologies (like Laravel, PHP, MySQL/PostgreSQL) to allow for potential future migration to different infrastructure environments or cloud platforms if NEEPCO's IT strategy evolves.
o	Justification: Avoids vendor lock-in and provides flexibility for future infrastructure changes.
